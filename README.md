# Sentiment_Analysis_using_DL_DT

This project focuses on classifying sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral) from text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. Sentiment analysis is a widely used task in real-world applications such as social media monitoring, product reviews, and customer feedback analysis.

**ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights**

**Text Preprocessing** â€“ Tokenized text, removed stopwords, and transformed inputs into sequences suitable for CNN processing.

**Feature Extractor as CNN** â€“Leveraged a Convolutional Neural Network to capture contextual and semantic patterns in the text.

**Classification with Decision Tree** â€“ Used extracted CNN features as input to a Decision Tree for final sentiment prediction.

**Evaluation** â€“ Used accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to assess performance.

**Results** â€“ Built a robust sentiment classification pipeline capable of handling unseen text data.
